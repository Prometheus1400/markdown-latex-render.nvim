# To Do List

- [ ] need to revise the key strategy as duplicate blocks in the code can be the same expression but should be rendered seperately

- [ ] be able to only render when hovering over latex

- [ ] be able to possibly hide the raw latex expression
* idea: make the text invisible and render the image above it. then when we hover over image - unrender it and make the raw latex visible again

- [ ] rerender on window size change? so that when zoomin in tmux it displays properly

- [ ] be able to render in a popup or something while typing
* this would require a smarter and faster image generation/rendering pipeline
